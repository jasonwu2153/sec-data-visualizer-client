# Yale University CPSC 437 Database SEC Data Visualizer Server

This repository is the frontend client for our (Jason Wu, Michael Lewkowicz, Kevin Zhang - Yale Undergrads) sec database visualizer. This client repo makes API calls to our [server](https://github.com/jasonwu2153/sec-data-visualizer-server) to get processed NPORT-P filing data. This server was written in TypeScript using the React web framework.

## Requirements

#### Getting Started

- Create a `.env` with the entry `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` in the root directory.
- Make sure you have a [server](https://github.com/jasonwu2153/sec-data-visualizer-server) instance running on port 5000.
- Run `yarn install` to install necessary dependencies.
- Finally run `yarn start`.

After completing the steps above, our visualizer should start in your browser.
